# Traders

SX is a liquidity exchange that strictly supports only highly available stable tokens as it's underlaying basket of liquidity pools. Using the concept of virtual reserves, SX can amplifify the liquidity pools which in result offers much better spreads for the traders on supported trading pairs.

## Step 1 (how to trade)

Send any of the supported stable token asset to the smart contract (`stablestable`) and include in the memo which asset you would like in return by providing the token `symbol_code` (ex: "`USDT`").

```
$ cleos transfer myaccount stablestable "1.0000 USDT" "EOSDT" --contract tethertether
```

## Step 2 (receipt)

Once a trade is completed, the account will be notified with a `receipt` ACTION which shows confirmation of the trade.

# Referrals

SX has an easy to implement referral system which allows any referral to signup for free and start earning fees from each trade that occurs using their platform.

### Step 1 (register referral)

Referrals must initiate the `setreferral` ACTION to be registered.

- `{name} name` - name of referral
- `{asset} transaction_fee` - transaction fee based in USD (ex: `0.01 USD`)
- `{map<eosio::name, string>} metadata_json` -  (optional) Metadata JSON (key/value pairs)

```bash
cleos push stablestable setreferral '["myreferral", "0.01 USD", [{"key":"website", "value": "https://myreferral.com"}]]' -p myreferral
```

### Step 2-A (include in transfer `memo`)

Referrals can append their referral account name to the token transfer.

### `schema`

```bash
"{symbol_code},{optional<name>}"
```

### `example`

```bash
"USDT,myreferral"
```

### Step 2-B (include `signup` action)

Referrals can include the `signup` action prior to the token transfer with the `account` as the authority.

- `{name} account` - account name
- `{name} referral` - name of referral

```bash
cleos push stablestable signup '["myaccount", "myreferral"]' -p myaccount
```

### **Referral Notes

- maximum transaction fee of `0.25 USD` per trade (lower fee could attract more traders).
- referrals will continue to earn fees even if their referred users does not include the referral memo.
- users can change their referral at anytime by including a different referral memo or using the `signup` action.
- both `convert` & `autoconvert` will earn fees for referrals.
- fees are earned based on the incoming quantity asset.
